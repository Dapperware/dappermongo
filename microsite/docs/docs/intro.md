## Why DapperMongo?

You might be wondering, why another wrapper library for MongoDB in Scala? The answer is simple: DapperMongo takes the best from each library and combines them into a single "dapper" library.

Here are some of the reasons why you should consider using DapperMongo:

- **Ease of Use**: DapperMongo is designed with simplicity in mind. It provides a straightforward and intuitive API that makes it easy to perform common database operations.

- **Efficiency**: By leveraging the power of ZIO and other high-performance libraries, DapperMongo ensures that your database operations are as efficient as possible.

- **Reliability**: DapperMongo is built on top of reliable libraries and uses ZIO's powerful error handling capabilities to ensure that your database operations are safe and reliable.

- **Best of All Worlds**: DapperMongo takes the best features from various MongoDB libraries and combines them into a single, easy-to-use package. This means you get the benefits of all these libraries without having to deal with their individual quirks and complexities.

So, if you're looking for a MongoDB library that's easy to use, efficient, reliable, and takes the best from each library, look no further than DapperMongo. We hope you'll find it to be a valuable tool in your Scala development toolkit.
